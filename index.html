    <h1>This is the first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
    <h2>this is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
    <h3>this is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
    <p>this is a <em>paragraph</em> As you can see, I placed an emphasis on the word "paragraph". Now I will change also the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color to green, all with just css.</p>
    <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
      <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
      <li>Show you how to program a web document with javascript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with Javascript</p>
    <p>First number:<span id="firstNum">5</span></p>
    <p>Second number:<span id="secondNum">7</span></p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is:<span id="answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
